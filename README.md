## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have installed NPM and the Angular CLI.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

First, after cloning the repo, you must install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To run the development server, just type:

```
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running the tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Deployment

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
