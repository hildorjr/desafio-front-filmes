# Desafio Front Filmes

This is a front-end challenge, made for SouthSystem, the requisites were the following:
* Create a website that uses the StarWars API: https://swapi.co/
* Must be developed in Angular or React
* Must have unit tests
* Must have a readme file
* Must be on a public repo (this one)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have installed NPM and the Angular CLI

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

First, after cloning the repo, you must install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

To run the development server, just type

```
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running the tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Deployment

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
